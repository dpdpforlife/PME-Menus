# PME-Menus
A set of menus and modal tools for Pie Menu Editor in Blender.

The selection tools are my additions to Vasyl Matsuk's *Select Steps More Less* PME setup. I added loop and ring more/less which requires the addon Zaloopok Tools. The menu is called with the Shift+z shortcut.

The Offset Edges tool uses the Mesh Tools addon that ships with Blender 2.80+. Press CTRL+Shift+Alt+E to enter an offset edges modal.
